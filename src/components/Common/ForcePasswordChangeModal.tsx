/**
 * Offered while an account is still on the password it was issued with.
 *
 * Agent and client accounts are created from a profile form with no password
 * box — they start on a shared company default that every colleague can
 * guess. This dialog is how that gets replaced.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * It does not ask for the current password. The person signed in with it
 * seconds ago, and it is the default anybody could have typed — asking again
 * proves nothing and only stands between a public account and a private one.
 * (The server still demands it for accounts past this stage; see
 * `changePassword`.)
 *
 * It can be dismissed, but not dealt with. Skipping lasts for this visit only —
 * the dialog comes back at the next sign-in, and every one after it, until the
 * password is actually changed. Nagging someone who is in the middle of
 * something is worse than nagging them tomorrow; letting it go silently is
 * worse than both.
