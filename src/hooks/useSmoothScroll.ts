/**
 * Smooth scrolling for the panel's main column.
 *
 * Bound to a wrapper element rather than the window, because that is where this
 * app actually scrolls: the page body never moves, the flex column beside the
 * sidebar does (see MainLayout). Left on its default, Lenis would attach to a
 * window that has no scroll to smooth and appear to do nothing at all.
 *
 * Two choices worth knowing about:
 *
 * - **Touch is left alone.** `syncTouch` stays off, so a phone keeps its native
 *   momentum scrolling. Lenis's touch mode replaces that with an interpolation
 *   that feels close but never quite right, and this panel's clients are on
 *   phones. Smoothing is a mouse-wheel nicety here, nothing more.
 *
 * - **Nested scrollers opt out** via `data-lenis-prevent`, which Lenis reads
 *   itself. Anything that scrolls inside the page — the date picker's preset
 *   list, a long stack trace — has to keep its own scroll, or the wheel over it
 *   would move the page behind it instead.
 *
 * Ant Design's modals and dropdowns need nothing: they portal to `document.body`,
 * outside the wrapper, and `eventsTarget` is the wrapper — so their wheel events
 * were never Lenis's to intercept.
